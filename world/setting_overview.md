# The Convergent Realm: A Three-Path Magic World

*Where industrial alchemy, biological mastery, and material affinity shape civilization*

## Core Premise

In the Convergent Realm, magic is as ubiquitous as air itself. Ambient magical energy permeates everything, creating a world where three fundamentally different approaches to magic have emerged. These three paths have shaped societies, economies, and conflicts throughout history, creating a complex civilization built on magical specialization.

## The Three Magical Paths

### Path One: Industrial Alchemy
**"Magic through machinery and chemistry"**

**Core Principle**: Machines collect ambient magic and compress it into liquid mana, which is then processed through magical chemistry to create spells.

**How It Works**:
- **Magic Reactors** draw ambient energy and pressurize it into liquid mana
- Different reactors produce different grades (concentrations) of liquid mana
- **Spell Chemistry**: Liquid mana is mixed, refined, and processed to create specific effects
- Final products: Throwable spells (bombs, vials), applied spells (healing salves, protective oils)
- Magic leaks from liquid form if not properly contained in pressurized storage

**Practitioners**: **Industrial Mages** - depend entirely on manufactured spells
- Cannot create magic themselves
- Require steady supply of liquid mana and processed spells
- Effectiveness depends on mana grade quality
- Economic power through mass production and distribution

### Path Two: Biological Mastery
**"Magic through the living body"**

**Core Principle**: Human bodies can absorb ambient magic and process it internally using "inner magic" - personal magical essence that acts as a catalyst.

**How It Works**:
- **Absorption**: Wizards draw ambient magic into their bodies
- **Internal Processing**: Inner magic refines ambient energy into usable spells
- **Casting Methods**:
  - **Touch Casting**: Direct spell activation through physical contact
  - **Impregnation**: Transfer processed magic into objects for delayed activation
- **Control**: Inner magic maintains connection to impregnated items for remote activation

**Practitioners**: **Wizards** - living magical processors
- Limited by personal absorption rate (determines max spell level)
- Can create flexible, customized spell effects
- Require time to absorb and process ambient magic
- Independent of external magical infrastructure

### Path Three: Material Affinity
**"Magic through elemental bonds"**

**Core Principle**: Some individuals can form permanent bonds between their inner magic and specific materials, gaining direct control without spell casting.

**How It Works**:
- **Affinity Awakening**: Discovering natural connection to a material type
- **Inner Magic Bond**: Permanent link between personal essence and chosen material
- **Direct Control**: Manipulation without spell slots or external magic
- **Material Types**: Wood, metal, stone, fabric, or elemental forces
- **Limitations**: One affinity per person, cannot create material from nothing

**Practitioners**: **Material Masters** - elemental controllers
- **Woodshapers**: Control trees, wooden items, plant growth
- **Metalsmiths**: Shape metals, animated weapons/armor
- **Stonemasons**: Earth manipulation, architectural control
- **Weavers**: Fabric magic, protective textiles
- **Elementalists**: Fire, water, air control

## Historical Context

### The Age of Discovery
