# TTRPG Development Progress

*Last Updated: August 30, 2025*

## Current Status ‚úÖ 
**Phase:** 1.3 - Character Framework (ACTIVE)  
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-8 (On Track)  
**Status:** Core Systems Complete - Ready for Character Creation  

## Phase Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ Setup & Planning (Completed)
- [x] Created project roadmap (ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Set up Claude Code configuration
- [x] Established progress tracking system

### üîÑ Phase 1: Core System Design (In Progress - Week 1)

#### 1.1 Combat & Core Mechanics (CRITICAL - Current Focus)
- [x] **Design pool system (Six D&D attributes) with flexible point spending** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create critical injury system (Year Zero Engine inspired)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create simplified tactical grid system (square-based with diagonal rules)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish dice mechanics (d20 + pool spending for difficulty reduction)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define action economy (action, move, bonus action simplified)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Design initiative system (DEX/Speed pool based)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create attack resolution mechanics** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define defense and armor rules** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish conditions system (stunned, prone, grappled, etc.)** ‚úÖ *Completed*

#### 1.2 Skills & Abilities System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Create comprehensive skill list with pool associations** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define specialties/proficiency system (untrained/trained/expert)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Design skill challenge mechanics** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish group skill check rules** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create opposed skill resolution** ‚úÖ *Completed*

#### 1.3 Character Framework (Upcoming)
- [ ] Design hybrid class system (D&D archetypes + pool specialization)
- [ ] Define starting pool distributions by class
- [ ] Create 20-level progression with meaningful choices each level
- [ ] Design background system
- [ ] Create step-by-step character creation guide

#### 1.4 Equipment & Magic Foundation (Upcoming)
- [ ] Create weapon list (melee/ranged) with pool damage
- [ ] Design armor and shield system
- [ ] Define basic tools and equipment
- [ ] Create spell casting mechanics using pools
- [ ] Establish concentration and spell interruption rules

### üìã Future Phases (Not Started)
- **Phase 2:** Complete Game Systems (Weeks 9-14) - Magic, Travel, Social
- **Phase 3:** Rules Documentation (Weeks 15-20)
- **Phase 4:** World Building (Weeks 21-26)
- **Phase 5:** Digital Implementation (Weeks 27-34)
- **Phase 6:** Playtesting & Refinement (Weeks 35-42)

## Files Created
- `ROADMAP.md` - Complete development plan (MAJOR REVISION)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration
- `.claude/commands/commit.md` - Commit helper
- `PROGRESS.md` - This progress tracking file (UPDATED)
- `.status.json` - Machine-readable progress tracking (NEEDS UPDATE)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed change history
- `rules/core_mechanics.md` - Six-pool system with flexible point spending ‚úÖ
- `rules/critical_injuries.md` - Year Zero-style injury system ‚úÖ
- `rules/zones_movement.md` - Grid-based tactical movement system ‚úÖ
- `rules/dice_mechanics.md` - Core d20 resolution with pool integration ‚úÖ
- `rules/action_economy.md` - Complete action/initiative system ‚úÖ
- `rules/combat.md` - Attack resolution, defense, and conditions ‚úÖ
- `rules/skills_abilities.md` - Comprehensive skill system ‚úÖ

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Remaining Core Systems (For character creation and play):
1. **Equipment System** - Weapons, armor, and gear needed for characters
2. **Character Creation** - Classes, backgrounds, and creation process
3. **Magic System** - Spellcasting mechanics for magical classes

## Next Immediate Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Create equipment.md** - Weapons, armor, tools, and gear
2. **Create character_creation.md** - Classes, backgrounds, step-by-step creation
3. **Create basic magic system** - Spellcasting mechanics for magical classes
4. **Begin playtesting** - Test combat and skill encounters

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Grid-based tactical combat with simplified distance calculation
- **Current Reality:** Many core systems missing - extended timeline required
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
