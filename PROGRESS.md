# TTRPG Development Progress

*Last Updated: August 30, 2025*

## Current Status
**Phase:** 1.1 - Define Core Mechanics  
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-4  
**Status:** Just Started  

## Phase Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ Setup & Planning (Completed)
- [x] Created project roadmap (ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Set up Claude Code configuration
- [x] Established progress tracking system

### üîÑ Phase 1: Core System Design (In Progress - Week 1)

#### 1.1 Define Core Mechanics (Current Focus)
- [ ] **Design pool system (Might/Speed/Intellect) with edge mechanics** ‚≠ê *Next Task*
- [ ] Create simplified tactical grid system (close/near/far zones vs feet/meters)
- [ ] Establish dice mechanics (d20 + pool spending for difficulty reduction)
- [ ] Define action economy (action, move, bonus action simplified)

#### 1.2 Character Framework (Upcoming)
- [ ] Design hybrid class system (D&D archetypes + Cypher descriptors/foci)
- [ ] Create comprehensive skill system (D&D 5e proficiency + Cypher training)
- [ ] Define 20-level progression with meaningful choices each level
- [ ] Establish pool-to-traditional attribute relationships

#### 1.3 Combat System (Upcoming)
- [ ] Design zone-based movement (no measuring distances)
- [ ] Create tactical positioning mechanics (flanking, cover, etc.)
- [ ] Define initiative system (Speed pool based)
- [ ] Establish conditions and status effects

### üìã Future Phases (Not Started)
- **Phase 2:** Rules Documentation (Weeks 5-8)
- **Phase 3:** World Building (Weeks 9-12)
- **Phase 4:** Digital Implementation (Weeks 13-20)
- **Phase 5:** Playtesting & Refinement (Weeks 21-28)

## Files Created
- `ROADMAP.md` - Complete development plan
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration
- `.claude/claude-commit.sh` - Commit helper script
- `PROGRESS.md` - This progress tracking file

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Design the pool system (Might/Speed/Intellect) with edge mechanics
2. Create project directory structure
3. Set up rules documentation files

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Zone-based tactical combat without distance measurement
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
