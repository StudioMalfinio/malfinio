# TTRPG Development Progress

*Last Updated: August 30, 2025*

## Current Status ‚ö†Ô∏è 
**Phase:** 1.1 - Combat & Core Mechanics (CRITICAL)  
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-8 (Extended due to missing systems)  
**Status:** Major Gaps Identified - Combat system must be priority  

## Phase Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ Setup & Planning (Completed)
- [x] Created project roadmap (ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Set up Claude Code configuration
- [x] Established progress tracking system

### üîÑ Phase 1: Core System Design (In Progress - Week 1)

#### 1.1 Combat & Core Mechanics (CRITICAL - Current Focus)
- [x] **Design pool system (Six D&D attributes) with flexible point spending** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create critical injury system (Year Zero Engine inspired)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [ ] Create simplified tactical grid system (close/near/far zones vs feet/meters) ‚≠ê *URGENT*
- [ ] Establish dice mechanics (d20 + pool spending for difficulty reduction) ‚≠ê *URGENT*
- [ ] Define action economy (action, move, bonus action simplified) ‚≠ê *URGENT*
- [ ] Design initiative system (DEX/Speed pool based) ‚≠ê *URGENT*
- [ ] Create attack resolution mechanics ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Define defense and armor rules ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Establish conditions system (stunned, prone, grappled, etc.) ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*

#### 1.2 Skills & Abilities System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create comprehensive skill list with pool associations ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Define specialties/proficiency system (untrained/trained/expert) ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Design skill challenge mechanics ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Establish group skill check rules ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*
- [ ] Create opposed skill resolution ‚ö†Ô∏è *MISSING*

#### 1.3 Character Framework (Upcoming)
- [ ] Design hybrid class system (D&D archetypes + pool specialization)
- [ ] Define starting pool distributions by class
- [ ] Create 20-level progression with meaningful choices each level
- [ ] Design background system
- [ ] Create step-by-step character creation guide

#### 1.4 Equipment & Magic Foundation (Upcoming)
- [ ] Create weapon list (melee/ranged) with pool damage
- [ ] Design armor and shield system
- [ ] Define basic tools and equipment
- [ ] Create spell casting mechanics using pools
- [ ] Establish concentration and spell interruption rules

### üìã Future Phases (Not Started)
- **Phase 2:** Complete Game Systems (Weeks 9-14) - Magic, Travel, Social
- **Phase 3:** Rules Documentation (Weeks 15-20)
- **Phase 4:** World Building (Weeks 21-26)
- **Phase 5:** Digital Implementation (Weeks 27-34)
- **Phase 6:** Playtesting & Refinement (Weeks 35-42)

## Files Created
- `ROADMAP.md` - Complete development plan (MAJOR REVISION)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration
- `.claude/commands/commit.md` - Commit helper
- `PROGRESS.md` - This progress tracking file (UPDATED)
- `.status.json` - Machine-readable progress tracking (NEEDS UPDATE)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed change history
- `rules/core_mechanics.md` - Six-pool system with flexible point spending ‚úÖ
- `rules/critical_injuries.md` - Year Zero-style injury system ‚úÖ

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Missing Core Systems (Cannot playtest without these):
1. **Combat System** - No attack resolution, no initiative, no actions
2. **Skills System** - No skill mechanics at all
3. **Equipment System** - No weapons, armor, or gear
4. **Character Creation** - Cannot make characters
5. **Magic System** - Completely absent

## Next Immediate Tasks (URGENT)
1. **Create combat.md** - Initiative, actions, attack resolution
2. **Create skills_abilities.md** - Skill list and mechanics  
3. **Create character_creation.md** - Step-by-step character building
4. **Create equipment.md** - Weapons and armor with pool damage

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Zone-based tactical combat without distance measurement
- **Current Reality:** Many core systems missing - extended timeline required
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
