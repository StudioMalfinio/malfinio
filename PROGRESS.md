## REMAINING SYSTEMS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ All Core Systems Complete!
Phase 1 fully implemented with all necessary mechanics.

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Fully Complete! üéâ
All core systems implemented - players can create complete characters with magic, engage in tactical combat, and progress through 20 levels!

## Next Immediate Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Begin playtesting** - Test complete core systems
2. **Create travel/exploration mechanics** - Journey and environment systems
3. **Create social interaction mechanics** - Enhanced roleplay systems
4. **Begin Phase 2** - Complete remaining game systems

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Grid-based tactical combat with simplified distance calculation
- **Current Reality:** Phase 1 fully complete! All core systems including magic implemented
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
