- [x] **Define basic tools and equipment** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [ ] Create spell casting mechanics using pools
- [ ] Establish concentration and spell interruption rules

### üìã Future Phases (Not Started)
- **Phase 2:** Complete Game Systems (Weeks 9-14) - Magic, Travel, Social
- **Phase 3:** Rules Documentation (Weeks 15-20)
- **Phase 4:** World Building (Weeks 21-26)
- **Phase 5:** Digital Implementation (Weeks 27-34)
- **Phase 6:** Playtesting & Refinement (Weeks 35-42)

## Files Created
- `ROADMAP.md` - Complete development plan (MAJOR REVISION)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration
- `.claude/commands/commit.md` - Commit helper
- `PROGRESS.md` - This progress tracking file (UPDATED)
- `.status.json` - Machine-readable progress tracking (NEEDS UPDATE)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed change history
- `rules/core_mechanics.md` - Six-pool system with flexible point spending ‚úÖ
- `rules/critical_injuries.md` - Year Zero-style injury system ‚úÖ
- `rules/zones_movement.md` - Grid-based tactical movement system ‚úÖ
- `rules/dice_mechanics.md` - Core d20 resolution with pool integration ‚úÖ
- `rules/action_economy.md` - Complete action/initiative system ‚úÖ
- `rules/combat.md` - Attack resolution, defense, and conditions ‚úÖ
- `rules/skills_abilities.md` - Comprehensive skill system ‚úÖ
- `rules/equipment.md` - Complete weapons, armor, and gear system ‚úÖ
- `rules/character_creation.md` - Complete character creation with 8 classes, backgrounds, and progression ‚úÖ

## REMAINING SYSTEMS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Core Systems Still Needed:
1. **Magic System** - Spellcasting mechanics for magical classes (Wizard, Cleric, Warlock, Bard)

### Phase 1 Almost Complete! üéâ
Character creation is now fully functional - players can create complete characters and engage in combat!

## Next Immediate Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Create basic magic system** - Pool-based spellcasting for magical classes
2. **Begin playtesting** - Test complete character creation and combat
3. **Create social interaction mechanics** - Enhanced roleplay systems
4. **Finalize Phase 1** - Complete remaining equipment/magic tasks

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Grid-based tactical combat with simplified distance calculation
- **Current Reality:** Character creation complete! Only magic system remains for Phase 1
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
