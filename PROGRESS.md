- [x] **Design initiative system (DEX/Speed pool based)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create attack resolution mechanics** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define defense and armor rules** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish conditions system (stunned, prone, grappled, etc.)** ‚úÖ *Completed*

#### 1.2 Skills & Abilities System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Create comprehensive skill list with pool associations** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define specialties/proficiency system (untrained/trained/expert)** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Design skill challenge mechanics** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish group skill check rules** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create opposed skill resolution** ‚úÖ *Completed*

#### 1.3 Character Framework (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Define starting pool distributions by class** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create 20-level progression with meaningful choices each level** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Design background system** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create step-by-step character creation guide** ‚úÖ *Completed*

#### 1.4 Equipment & Magic Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Create weapon list (melee/ranged) with pool damage** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Design armor and shield system** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Define basic tools and equipment** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Create spell casting mechanics using pools** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- [x] **Establish concentration and spell interruption rules** ‚úÖ *Completed*

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Complete Game Systems (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 2.1:** Magic system expanded and integrated
- **Phase 2.2:** Travel & Exploration - Zone-based mechanics with environmental challenges
- **Phase 2.3:** Social Interaction - Structured social encounters with reputation systems

### üìã Phase 3: Rules Documentation (PENDING)
- **Phase 3.1:** Player's Handbook creation (after worldbuilding)
- **Phase 3.2:** Game Master's Guide creation (after worldbuilding)

### üîÑ Phase 4: World Building (ACTIVE)
- **Phase 4.1:** Setting Creation - Genre, history, locations, factions
- **Phase 4.2:** Starter Content - Adventure design and pre-gen characters

**Strategic Rationale:** Creating the world first allows the setting to inform final rule adjustments, spell lists, faction details, and equipment specifics before documenting everything.
- **Phase 3:** Rules Documentation (Weeks 15-20)
- **Phase 4:** World Building (Weeks 21-26)
- **Phase 5:** Digital Implementation (Weeks 27-34)
- **Phase 6:** Playtesting & Refinement (Weeks 35-42)

## REMAINING SYSTEMS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ All Game Systems Complete!
Phases 1 & 2 fully implemented - complete playable game system ready for documentation.

### ‚úÖ Phase 2 Fully Complete! üéâ
Complete game system implemented - players can create characters, engage in tactical combat, explore the world, and navigate complex social encounters!

## Next Immediate Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Create setting overview** - Define genre, tone, and world concepts
2. **Establish world locations** - Key regions and important places
3. **Design major factions** - Organizations and power structures
4. **Develop world history** - Timeline and major events that inform current state

## Quick Reference
- **Project Goal:** Hybrid TTRPG combining Cypher System pools with D&D 5e combat
- **Key Innovation:** Grid-based tactical combat with simplified distance calculation
- **Current Reality:** Phase 2 complete! Moving to strategic worldbuilding before documentation
- **Success Metrics:** Complete ruleset, successful playtests, functional digital tools
