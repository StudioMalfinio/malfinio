# Magic System

*Pool-based spellcasting integrating with the six-pool hybrid system*

## Overview

Magic in this system combines traditional D&D spell slots with pool enhancement mechanics. Spellcasters use their mental pools (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) to power magic while still maintaining the familiar spell level structure.

## Core Spellcasting Mechanics

### Spell Attack Rolls
**Formula**: 1d20 + proficiency + (casting pool max / 5) + Edge + pool points spent

- **Wizard**: 1d20 + proficiency + (INT pool max / 5) + INT Edge + INT points spent
- **Cleric**: 1d20 + proficiency + (WIS pool max / 5) + WIS Edge + WIS points spent
- **Warlock/Bard**: 1d20 + proficiency + (CHA pool max / 5) + CHA Edge + CHA points spent

### Spell Save DC
**Formula**: 8 + proficiency + (casting pool max / 5) + Edge + pool points spent

- **Example**: Level 5 Wizard with INT 18 → DC 8 + 3 + 3 + Edge + spending
- **Enhancement**: Can spend pool points to increase DC for individual spells

### Pool Enhancement Options
When casting any spell, casters can spend pool points for:

#### Accuracy Enhancement
- **Cost**: 1 pool point = +1 to spell attack roll
- **Use**: Declare before rolling attack
- **Example**: Spending 3 INT points on Fire Bolt for +3 to hit

#### Save DC Enhancement
- **Cost**: 1 pool point = +1 to spell save DC
- **Use**: Declare when casting spell that requires save
- **Example**: Spending 2 WIS points to make Hold Person DC 17 instead of 15

#### Damage Enhancement (Limited)
- **Cost**: 2 pool points = +1 damage per die rolled
- **Use**: Only on damage-dealing spells
- **Example**: Spending 4 INT points on Fireball adds +2 to each damage die
