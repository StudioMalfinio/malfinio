# Magic System

*Skill-based spellcasting integrating with the pool allocation system*

## Overview

Magic in this system requires allocating pool points to magic skills rather than spending them for temporary enhancements. Spellcasters must dedicate portions of their mental pools (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) to maintain their magical abilities, creating strategic choices about magical power versus versatility.

## Core Spellcasting Mechanics

### Spell Attack Rolls
**Formula**: 1d20 + proficiency + magic skill bonuses

**Examples by Class**:
- **Wizard**: 1d20 + proficiency + INT-based magic skill bonuses
- **Cleric**: 1d20 + proficiency + WIS-based magic skill bonuses
- **Warlock/Bard**: 1d20 + proficiency + CHA-based magic skill bonuses

### Spell Save DC
**Formula**: 8 + proficiency + relevant ability modifier + magic skill bonuses

**Examples**:
- Level 5 Wizard with INT 18: DC 8 + 3 + 4 + skill bonuses
- Level 3 Cleric with WIS 16: DC 8 + 2 + 3 + skill bonuses

### Magic Skills Enhancement
Magic skills provide various enhancements to spellcasting:

#### Spell Power Skills
**Spell Mastery** (6 INT - Wizard only)
- Passive: +2 to spell attack rolls and save DCs
- Active: Cast spell at +1 caster level (once per long rest)

**Divine Authority** (5 WIS + 1 CHA - Cleric only)
- Passive: +1 to spell save DCs, healing spells heal +2 SP
- Active: Next spell affects double the normal targets

**Eldritch Power** (6 CHA - Warlock only)
- Passive: Eldritch Blast gains +2 damage per beam
- Active: Next spell regains the spell slot used (once per long rest)

#### Utility Magic Skills
**Spell Matrix** (4 INT - Wizard)
- Passive: Prepare +2 spells beyond normal limit
- Active: Change one prepared spell during short rest

**Ritual Master** (3 INT + 2 WIS - Any caster)
- Passive: All ritual spells take half normal time
- Active: Cast any spell you know as a ritual (once per long rest)

**Arcane Shield** (3 INT - Wizard/Warlock)
- Passive: +2 SP when concentrating on spells
- Active: Absorb targeted spell, gain spell slot of same level (reaction)
