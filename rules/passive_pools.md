# Passive Pool Allocation System

*Pool points are your character's core currency for activating skills and abilities*

## Overview

Instead of spending pool points for temporary bonuses on dice rolls, you allocate pool points to activate skills and abilities that provide lasting benefits. This creates strategic character builds where your pool distribution defines your capabilities.

## Core Principles

### Pool Allocation Rules
- **Allocation Time**: During long rests or extended downtime (4+ hours)
- **Reallocation**: Can change allocations during each long rest
- **No Active Spending**: Pool points cannot be spent for dice roll bonuses
- **Skill Requirements**: Each skill requires specific pool point combinations

### Skill Types

#### Passive Skills (Always Active)
Provide constant benefits when allocated:
- **Combat Reflexes** (2 DEX + 1 WIS): +2 SP permanently
- **Weapon Master** (4 STR): +2 to all weapon attack rolls
- **Arcane Shield** (3 INT): +2 SP when concentrating on spells

#### Active Skills (Require Trigger)
Must be activated with an action/bonus action/reaction:
- **Power Strike** (3 STR + 1 CON): Next attack deals double damage
- **Lightning Dodge** (4 DEX): Automatically dodge next attack
- **Spell Burst** (5 INT): Cast two cantrips as one action

#### Hybrid Skills (Passive + Active Components)
Provide both constant benefits and triggerable effects:
- **Hunter's Focus** (2 WIS + 2 DEX): 
  - Passive: +1 to perception checks
  - Active: Mark target for advantage on attacks

## Multi-Pool Requirements

Skills can require points from multiple pools, creating interesting allocation puzzles:

### Combat Skills Examples
- **Blade Dance** (3 DEX + 2 STR): Passive +1 melee attacks, Active: Attack all adjacent enemies
- **Iron Stance** (4 CON + 2 STR): Passive: Resist forced movement, Active: Halve next damage
- **Berserker's Fury** (5 CON + 3 STR): Active: +4 damage but -2 SP for 3 rounds

### Magic Skills Examples  
- **Spell Weaving** (4 INT + 1 WIS): Passive: +1 spell save DC, Active: Cast two spells simultaneously
- **Divine Channel** (4 WIS + 2 CHA): Passive: Healing +2 HP, Active: Heal affects all allies within 15 feet
- **Arcane Battery** (6 INT): Passive: +1 spell slot per spell level, Active: Regain expended slot

### Social Skills Examples
- **Silver Tongue** (3 CHA + 2 INT): Passive: Advantage on deception, Active: Make target believe one lie
- **Intimidating Presence** (3 STR + 2 CHA): Passive: Enemies -1 to hit you, Active: Frighten all visible enemies
- **Natural Leader** (4 CHA + 1 WIS): Passive: Allies +1 to saves, Active: Grant ally extra action

## Character Build Examples

## Skill Learning & Progression

### Starting Skills (Level 1)
- **Basic Skills**: 3 skills total
- **Requirements**: Skills available must match your pool values
- **Class Restrictions**: Some skills locked to specific classes

### Skill Acquisition
- **Every 2 levels**: Learn 1 new skill
- **Training**: Can learn skills during downtime (cost: 100 GP × skill requirement total, time: 1 week)
- **Class Features**: Some levels grant specific class skills automatically

### Skill Tiers
- **Basic (Levels 1-5)**: Low requirements, moderate effects
- **Advanced (Levels 6-10)**: Higher costs, stronger abilities
- **Master (Levels 11-15)**: Complex multi-pool requirements, powerful effects
- **Legendary (Levels 16-20)**: Extreme costs, game-changing abilities

## Strategic Considerations

### Build Planning
- **Specialization vs Versatility**: Focus on few powerful skills or spread for flexibility
- **Pool Balance**: Overallocating one pool limits future options
- **Synergy**: Some skills work better together
- **Adaptability**: Save some unallocated points for unexpected situations

### Tactical Flexibility
- **Daily Reallocation**: Change your build based on expected challenges
- **Emergency Reallocation**: Some skills allow mid-adventure changes (with penalties)
- **Group Synergy**: Coordinate allocations with party members
- **Situational Skills**: Keep utility skills available for specific scenarios

### Risk Management
- **Pool Diversity**: Don't put all points in one pool
- **Essential Skills**: Always maintain core combat/survival abilities
- **Backup Plans**: Have skills that work even if others become unavailable
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance between must-have and nice-to-have skills

## Class Integration

### Fighter - Combat Specialists
Focus on STR/CON/DEX combinations:
- Master weapon skills and defensive abilities
- High-cost combat skills for devastating effects
- Pool synergy between physical attributes

### Wizard - Arcane Scholars  
Heavily INT-focused with WIS support:
- Spell enhancement and magical utility
- Knowledge and investigation abilities
- Mental pool optimization

### Rogue - Skill Experts

- Adaptable build options

### Cleric - Divine Channelers

## Advanced Mechanics

### Skill Synergies
Certain skill combinations provide bonus effects:
- **Spell Matrix** + **Quick Thinking** = Cast an extra spell during surprise round
- **Weapon Master** + **Brutal Critical** = Critical hits deal triple damage instead of double
- **Silver Tongue** + **Intimidating Presence** = Can switch between charm and fear as bonus action

### Skill Evolution
At certain levels, basic skills can evolve into more powerful versions:
- **Weapon Master** → **Grand Master** (Level 11): Requires 6 STR + 2 DEX, adds critical threat range
- **Spell Matrix** → **Arcane Codex** (Level 15): Requires 8 INT + 4 WIS, allows unlimited cantrips

### Emergency Reallocation
Special circumstances allowing skill changes outside of rest:
- **Crisis Reallocation**: Spend 1 level of exhaustion to reallocate 1/3 of your pools
- **Magical Reallocation**: Certain spells or items can temporarily change allocations
- **Environmental Factors**: Some locations may force or allow skill changes
