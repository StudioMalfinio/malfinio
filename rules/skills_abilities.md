# Skills & Abilities System

*Comprehensive skill mechanics integrating with the six-pool system*

## Overview

This system defines how characters use their abilities outside of combat, from picking locks to convincing nobles. Each skill is associated with one of the six pools, and characters can enhance their performance by spending pool points strategically.

## Core Skill Mechanics

### Basic Skill Check
**Formula**: 1d20 + proficiency (if trained) + (pool max / 5) + Edge + pool points spent

### The Resolution Process
1. **GM Sets Task & DC**: Determine difficulty and consequences
2. **Choose Skill & Pool**: Select appropriate skill and associated pool
3. **Declare Pool Spending**: Announce points spent before rolling (within Effort limits)
4. **Roll & Apply Bonuses**: 1d20 + all bonuses
5. **Resolve Outcome**: Compare total to DC, describe results

## Advanced Skill Mechanics

### Skill Challenges
Complex tasks requiring multiple successful rolls over time.

#### Structure
