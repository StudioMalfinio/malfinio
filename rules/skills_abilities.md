# Skills & Abilities System

*Comprehensive skill mechanics integrating with the pool allocation system*

## Overview

This system defines how characters use their abilities in all situations. Rather than spending pool points for temporary bonuses, characters allocate pool points to maintain skills permanently. These allocated skills provide consistent bonuses to relevant rolls and unlock special abilities.

## Core Skill Mechanics

### Basic Skill Check
**Formula**: 1d20 + proficiency (if trained) + allocated skill bonuses

### The Resolution Process
1. **GM Sets Task & DC**: Determine difficulty and consequences
2. **Choose Applicable Skills**: Determine which allocated skills apply
3. **Roll & Apply Bonuses**: 1d20 + proficiency + skill bonuses
4. **Resolve Outcome**: Compare total to DC, describe results

#### Structure
1. **Set Goal**: Define what success achieves
2. **Determine Complexity**: Simple (4 successes), Moderate (6), Hard (8)
3. **Set Applicable Skills**: List 3-5 skills characters can use
4. **Failure Threshold**: Usually 3 failures before completing successes
5. **Consequences**: Results for partial success, failure, or complications

#### Example: Infiltrating Noble's Estate
- **Goal**: Enter and gather information undetected
