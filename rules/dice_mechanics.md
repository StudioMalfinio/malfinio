# Dice Mechanics System

*Core resolution mechanics using skills and proficiency with d20 rolls*

## Core Resolution System

### Basic Roll
- **Standard**: Always roll 1d20 + proficiency + skill bonuses
- **No Pool Spending**: Pool points cannot be spent for temporary bonuses
- **Skill Enhancement**: All bonuses come from allocated skills
- **Proficiency**: Based on class training and background

### The Resolution Process
1. **Declare Intent**: State what you're attempting
2. **GM Sets DC**: Difficulty determined (or skill has fixed DC)
3. **Apply Skills**: Determine which allocated skills apply
4. **Roll Die**: 1d20 + proficiency + skill bonuses
5. **Compare to DC**: Success if total meets or beats DC

## Difficulty Classes

### Standard DC Scale
- **DC 5**: Trivial (automatic for most characters)
- **DC 10**: Easy (untrained person has 50% chance)
- **DC 15**: Medium (trained person needed for reliability)
- **DC 20**: Hard (expert required for consistent success)
- **DC 25**: Very Hard (master with significant effort)
- **DC 30**: Nearly Impossible (legendary achievement)

### Situational Modifiers
- **Favorable Conditions**: -2 to DC
- **Unfavorable Conditions**: +2 to DC
- **Extremely Difficult**: +5 to DC
- **Perfect Setup**: -5 to DC

## Proficiency System

### Proficiency Bonus by Level
```
Levels 1-4:   +2
Levels 5-8:   +3  
Levels 9-12:  +4
Levels 13-16: +5
Levels 17-20: +6
```

### Training Levels
- **Untrained**: No proficiency bonus, can still attempt most checks
- **Trained**: Add full proficiency bonus to rolls
- **Expert**: Trained + additional +2 bonus (from skills/class features)
- **Master**: Trained + additional +4 bonus (from advanced skills)

## Group Rolls

### Group Skill Checks
When multiple characters attempt the same task:

- **Multiple Attempts**: May allow repeated rolls

### Extended Checks

- **Time Pressure**: May have rounds or minutes between attempts

### Skill Challenges
For complex narrative obstacles:
- **Multiple Skills**: Various approaches accepted
- **Success Threshold**: Party needs total successes
