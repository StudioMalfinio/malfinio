# Action Economy System

*Streamlined combat actions integrating pool mechanics with tactical choice*

## Overview

This system defines how characters act during combat rounds, combining D&D 5e's familiar action types with our six-pool spending system for enhanced tactical options.

## Initiative System

### Initiative Order
- **Initiative Roll**: 1d20 + (DEX pool max / 5) + Edge + pool points (declared before rolling)
- **Alternative**: Use WIS pool instead of DEX for characters who rely on awareness over speed
- **Act in Order**: Highest to lowest, with ties going to higher DEX/WIS pool value

### Pool-Enhanced Initiative
- **Spend DEX Points**: Add +1 per point spent on initiative roll (within Effort limits)
- **Delay Initiative**: Choose to act later in the round, can interrupt before any character's turn
- **Ready Action**: Set specific trigger to act during someone else's turn

### Group Initiative (Optional)
- **Squad-Based**: All PCs roll together, take average
- **Advantage**: PCs coordinate timing and can act in any order they choose
- **Disadvantage**: Enemies also act as cohesive units

## Turn Structure

Each character's turn consists of:

### Movement
- **Base Movement**: 6 squares (30 feet) per turn
- **Terrain Interaction**: Moving through difficult terrain costs double
- **Split Movement**: Can move before and after your action

### One Standard Action
Choose one:
- Attack (weapon or spell)
- Cast a Spell (if casting time is 1 action)
- Dash (double movement for this turn)
- Disengage (avoid opportunity attacks when leaving melee)
- Dodge (all attacks against you have disadvantage until next turn)
- Help (give ally advantage on next roll)
- Hide (attempt stealth while breaking line of sight)
- Ready (prepare action with specific trigger)
- Search (actively look for hidden enemies/objects)
- Use Object (interact with complex items/mechanisms)

### One Bonus Action (If Available)
- **Class Features**: Many abilities use bonus actions
- **Two-Weapon Fighting**: Attack with off-hand weapon
- **Pool Abilities**: Quick recovery or enhancement actions
- **Spell Casting**: Some spells have bonus action casting time

### Unlimited Free Actions
- **Communication**: Brief speech (few words)
- **Simple Interactions**: Draw/sheathe weapon, open unlocked door
- **Drop Items**: Let go of held objects
- **Simple Gestures**: Point, nod, basic hand signals

### Reactions (If Triggered)
- **Opportunity Attacks**: Strike when enemy leaves your melee range
- **Defensive Abilities**: Block, parry, or counter-attack
- **Spell Reactions**: Cast spells with reaction timing
- **Pool Reactions**: Spend points for immediate defensive bonuses

## Pool-Enhanced Actions

### Extra Actions
- **Second Standard Action**: Spend 4 points from any pool
- **Second Bonus Action**: Spend 2 points from any pool  
- **Extra Movement**: Spend 1 DEX point per 3 additional squares moved
- **Limitations**: Cannot take the same action twice (no double attacks with same weapon)

### Enhanced Movement Options
- **Sprint**: Spend standard action + 2 DEX points for 12 squares movement, cannot attack
- **Disengage Plus**: Spend 2 DEX points to avoid opportunity attacks for entire turn
- **Charge**: Move 4+ squares toward enemy, spend 1 STR point for +2 damage but -2 AC until next turn
- **Tactical Reposition**: Spend 3 DEX points to move without provoking opportunity attacks

### Quick Recovery Actions
- **Second Wind**: Spend 2 CON points + bonus action to recover 1d6 + (CON pool max / 5) hit points
- **Focus**: Spend 2 WIS points + bonus action to recover 1d4 points to any pool
- **Rally**: Spend 2 CHA points + bonus action to let ally spend reaction to move or take free action

## Combat Round Flow

### 1. Initiative Phase
- Roll initiative once at start of combat
- Declare any pool points spent on initiative before rolling
- Establish turn order for entire combat

### 2. Action Phase
Each character on their turn:
1. **Declare Actions**: State intended standard action and movement
2. **Declare Pool Spending**: Announce points spent for action enhancement
3. **Resolve Movement**: Move up to speed, split before/after action if desired
4. **Resolve Action**: Perform standard action with pool bonuses applied
5. **Resolve Bonus Action**: If available and desired
6. **End Turn**: Check for ongoing effects, conditions

### 3. Reaction Timing
- **During Other Turns**: React to triggers as they occur
- **Simultaneous Resolution**: Multiple reactions to same trigger resolve in initiative order
- **Pool Spending**: Can spend points on reaction rolls normally

## Special Action Rules

### Broken State Interactions
When a pool reaches 0, immediate consequences apply:
- **STR 0**: Cannot make attacks until end of turn, drop held items
- **DEX 0**: No movement this turn, cannot take reactions
- **CON 0**: Skip entire next turn (winded)
- **INT 0**: Lose concentration, cannot cast spells requiring components
- **WIS 0**: Cannot take reactions until end of turn
- **CHA 0**: Cannot communicate or use social abilities this turn

### Multiple Enemies
- **Group Actions**: Similar enemies can act simultaneously to speed play
- **Minion Rules**: Weak enemies (1 hit point) go down from any damage
- **Swarm Mechanics**: Large groups act as single entity with enhanced abilities

### Environmental Actions
- **Climbing**: Requires movement and potential STR checks
- **Swimming**: Half movement speed, potential CON checks
- **Flying**: Full movement in three dimensions (if capable)
- **Cover Usage**: Move behind cover as part of movement
- **Interaction**: Complex object use may require standard action

## Timing and Interruptions

### Held Actions
- **Ready Action**: Use standard action to prepare response to trigger
- **Trigger Occurs**: Immediately interrupt turn order to act
- **Unused Ready**: If trigger doesn't occur, action is lost

### Reactions Window
- **After Declaration**: React to declared actions before rolling
- **After Rolling**: React to results (hit/miss, success/failure)
- **During Movement**: React to specific movement triggers
- **Instantaneous**: Reactions resolve immediately when triggered

### Simultaneous Actions
When timing is unclear:
1. **All Parties Roll**: Use relevant skill (DEX for speed, INT for tactics)
2. **Highest Acts First**: Then resolve in descending order
3. **Pool Spending**: Can enhance these timing rolls normally

## Advanced Tactics

### Coordination
- **Help Action**: Grant ally advantage on next roll
- **Flanking**: Positioning grants automatic advantage
- **Combined Actions**: Multiple characters coordinate complex maneuvers

### Resource Management
- **Conservative Play**: Save pool points for crucial moments
- **Aggressive Bursts**: Spend heavily for decisive advantages  
- **Emergency Reserves**: Keep minimum pools for defense
- **Recovery Planning**: Balance action economy with pool regeneration

### Battlefield Control
- **Positioning**: Use movement to control engagement range
- **Opportunity Attacks**: Force enemies into difficult choices
- **Environmental Use**: Leverage terrain and objects tactically
- **Information Warfare**: Use Search/Perception to reveal enemy capabilities
