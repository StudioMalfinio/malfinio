# Action Economy System

*Streamlined combat actions integrating skill mechanics with tactical choice*

## Overview

This system defines how characters act during combat rounds, combining D&D 5e's familiar action types with our skill-based enhancement system for tactical options.

## Initiative System

### Initiative Order
- **Initiative Roll**: 1d20 + DEX modifier + relevant skill bonuses
- **Alternative**: Use WIS modifier + Danger Sense or other perception skills for awareness-based initiative
- **Act in Order**: Highest to lowest, with ties going to higher DEX/WIS modifier

### Skill-Enhanced Initiative
- **Lightning Reflexes**: Provides +3 to initiative and allows regaining reaction
- **Quick Thinking**: Provides +2 to initiative and extra action on first round
- **Delay Initiative**: Choose to act later in the round, can interrupt before any character's turn
- **Ready Action**: Set specific trigger to act during someone else's turn

### Group Initiative (Optional)
- **Squad-Based**: All PCs roll together, take average
- **Advantage**: PCs coordinate timing and can act in any order they choose
- **Disadvantage**: Enemies also act as cohesive units

## Turn Structure

Each character's turn consists of:

### Movement
- **Base Movement**: 6 squares (30 feet) per turn
- **Terrain Interaction**: Moving through difficult terrain costs double
- **Split Movement**: Can move before and after your action

### One Standard Action
Choose one:
- Attack (weapon or spell)
- Cast a Spell (if casting time is 1 action)
- Dash (double movement for this turn)
- Disengage (avoid opportunity attacks when leaving melee)
- Dodge (all attacks against you have disadvantage until next turn)
- Help (give ally advantage on next roll)
- Hide (attempt stealth while breaking line of sight)
- Ready (prepare action with specific trigger)
- Search (actively look for hidden enemies/objects)
- Use Object (interact with complex items/mechanisms)

### One Bonus Action (If Available)
- **Class Features**: Many abilities use bonus actions
- **Two-Weapon Fighting**: Attack with off-hand weapon
- **Skill Abilities**: Active skill effects that use bonus actions
- **Spell Casting**: Some spells have bonus action casting time

### Unlimited Free Actions
- **Communication**: Brief speech (few words)
- **Simple Interactions**: Draw/sheathe weapon, open unlocked door
- **Drop Items**: Let go of held objects
- **Simple Gestures**: Point, nod, basic hand signals

### Reactions (If Triggered)
- **Opportunity Attacks**: Strike when enemy leaves your melee range
- **Defensive Abilities**: Block, parry, or counter-attack enhanced by defensive skills
- **Spell Reactions**: Cast spells with reaction timing
- **Skill Reactions**: Abilities like Iron Stance or Guardian that use reactions

## Skill-Enhanced Actions

### Extra Actions from Skills
- **Action Surge** (Fighter): Gain extra action once per rest
- **Quick Thinking**: Extra action on first round of combat
- **Natural Leader**: Grant ally extra action on their turn
- **Limitations**: Cannot take the same action twice (no double attacks with same weapon)

### Enhanced Movement Options
- **Sprint**: Use standard action for double movement, cannot attack
- **Acrobat**: Ignore difficult terrain, move through enemy spaces without provoking
- **Fast Movement**: Barbarian and other skills provide +10 feet base movement
- **Lightning Reflexes**: Provides bonus movement and initiative

### Recovery Actions
- **Second Wind**: Fighter ability, bonus action to recover SP without resource cost
- **Regeneration**: Passive healing when below half SP from CON-based skill
- **Natural Leader**: Inspire ally to take additional actions

## Combat Round Flow

### 1. Initiative Phase
- Roll initiative once at start of combat
- Declare any pool points spent on initiative before rolling
- Establish turn order for entire combat

### 2. Action Phase
Each character on their turn:
1. **Declare Actions**: State intended standard action and movement
2. **Apply Skill Bonuses**: Skills provide automatic bonuses to relevant actions
3. **Resolve Movement**: Move up to speed, split before/after action if desired
4. **Resolve Action**: Perform standard action with skill bonuses applied
5. **Resolve Bonus Action**: If available and desired
6. **End Turn**: Check for ongoing effects, conditions

### 3. Reaction Timing
- **During Other Turns**: React to triggers as they occur
- **Simultaneous Resolution**: Multiple reactions to same trigger resolve in initiative order
- **Skill Enhancement**: Defensive skills enhance reaction abilities

## Special Action Rules

### Injury State Interactions
When SP reaches 0, injury accumulation begins:
- **Minor Injuries**: -1 to relevant rolls, manageable pain
- **Moderate Injuries**: -2 to rolls, significant hindrance
- **Major Injuries**: -3 to rolls, severe limitations
- **Critical Injuries**: Incapacitated, requires immediate medical attention

### Multiple Enemies
- **Group Actions**: Similar enemies can act simultaneously to speed play
- **Minion Rules**: Weak enemies (1 hit point) go down from any damage
- **Swarm Mechanics**: Large groups act as single entity with enhanced abilities

### Environmental Actions
- **Climbing**: Requires movement and potential STR checks
- **Swimming**: Half movement speed, potential CON checks
- **Flying**: Full movement in three dimensions (if capable)
- **Cover Usage**: Move behind cover as part of movement
- **Interaction**: Complex object use may require standard action

## Timing and Interruptions

### Held Actions
- **Ready Action**: Use standard action to prepare response to trigger
- **Trigger Occurs**: Immediately interrupt turn order to act
- **Unused Ready**: If trigger doesn't occur, action is lost

### Reactions Window
- **After Declaration**: React to declared actions before rolling
- **After Rolling**: React to results (hit/miss, success/failure)
- **During Movement**: React to specific movement triggers
- **Instantaneous**: Reactions resolve immediately when triggered

### Simultaneous Actions
When timing is unclear:
1. **All Parties Roll**: Use relevant skill (DEX for speed, INT for tactics)
2. **Highest Acts First**: Then resolve in descending order
3. **Skill Enhancement**: Relevant allocated skills enhance timing rolls

## Advanced Tactics

### Coordination
- **Help Action**: Grant ally advantage on next roll
- **Flanking**: Positioning grants automatic advantage
- **Combined Actions**: Multiple characters coordinate complex maneuvers

### Resource Management
- **Active Abilities**: Manage limited-use skill abilities carefully
- **AP/SP**: Balance tactical damage allocation choices
- **Class Resources**: Manage spell slots, rage uses, etc.
- **Recovery Planning**: Balance action economy with rest-based recovery

### Battlefield Control
- **Positioning**: Use movement to control engagement range
- **Opportunity Attacks**: Force enemies into difficult choices
- **Environmental Use**: Leverage terrain and objects tactically
- **Information Warfare**: Use Search/Perception to reveal enemy capabilities
