# Multiclassing Rules

*Optional rules for combining classes in the pool-based system*

## Prerequisites

To multiclass, you must meet pool requirements for both your current class and the class you're adding.

### Pool Requirements by Class
- **Fighter**: STR 13+
- **Rogue**: DEX 13+
- **Ranger**: DEX 13+ and WIS 13+
- **Barbarian**: CON 13+
- **Wizard**: INT 13+
- **Cleric**: WIS 13+
- **Warlock**: CHA 13+
- **Bard**: CHA 13+

### Requirements Check
- **Leaving Class**: Must meet requirements for current class to multiclass out
- **Entering Class**: Must meet requirements for new class to multiclass in
- **Pool Values**: Use current pool maximums, not starting values

## Pool Progression

### Primary Pool Growth
When you gain a level in a class:
- **Automatic +1**: Goes to the new class's primary pool
- **Player Choice +2**: Distribute as desired among all six pools

### Examples
- **Fighter 3/Rogue 1**: Next level goes to Rogue → +1 automatic to DEX, +2 player choice
- **Wizard 5/Cleric 2**: Next level goes to Cleric → +1 automatic to WIS, +2 player choice

### Edge Progression
- **Starting Edge**: Only gain when taking first level in a class
- **Regular Edge**: Gain every 4 total character levels regardless of class split
- **Example**: Fighter 2/Rogue 1 gains Edge at total level 4 (next level up)

## Class Features

### Hit Points
- **Formula**: New class's hit die average + (CON pool max / 3)
- **No Minimum**: Unlike single-class characters, no special HP bonuses
- **Example**: Fighter 1 (12 HP) taking Wizard → gains 8 + (CON/3) HP

## Spellcasting

### Spell Slots
Multiclass spellcasters use combined caster levels to determine spell slots.

#### Caster Level Calculation
- **Full Casters** (Wizard, Cleric): All levels count
- **Third Casters** (Bard): Divide levels by 3 (round down)
- **Pact Casters** (Warlock): Special rules (see below)

#### Combined Spell Slot Table
Use total caster levels to determine spell slots:

| Caster Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1            | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 2            | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 3            | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 4            | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 5            | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |

### Warlock Multiclassing
Warlock slots are separate from other spellcasting:
- **Pact Slots**: Track separately, recharge on short rest
- **Regular Slots**: Combine with other classes normally
- **Spell Level**: Can cast known spells using either slot type

### Spells Known/Prepared
Each class tracks separately:
- **Spells Known**: Bard and Warlock know spells individually
- **Spells Prepared**: Wizard, Cleric prepare spells using class levels only
- **Cantrips**: Total number from all classes combined

### Pool Enhancement
- **Spell Attacks**: Use the class's pool for the specific spell
- **Save DCs**: Use the class's pool that granted the spell
- **Example**: Wizard/Cleric uses INT for wizard spells, WIS for cleric spells

## Examples of Multiclass Builds

### Fighter 3/Rogue 2 (Level 5)

- **Edge**: 1 STR Edge (Fighter start) + 1 any Edge (level 5) = distributed as desired
- **HP**: 12 (Fighter) + 10 (Rogue) + CON bonuses = ~27-30 HP

### Wizard 5/Cleric 1 (Level 6)

## Multiclass Restrictions

### Armor and Weapons

- **Spellcasting**: Heavy armor may restrict spellcasting for some classes

### Class Feature Interactions
- **Extra Attacks**: Don't stack, take the highest
- **Unarmored Defense**: Choose one method, can't combine  
- **Proficiency**: Higher proficiency bonus applies to all classes
- **Pool Limitations**: Each class's features use their designated pools

### Advancement Planning
- **Early Levels**: Consider prerequisites and immediate benefits
- **Mid Levels**: Plan around key breakpoints (5th, 11th level features)
- **Late Levels**: High-level features vs broader capabilities

## Sample Multiclass Concepts

- **Concept**: Warrior-mage with spells and martial prowess

### Holy Warrior (Cleric/Fighter)
- **Concept**: Divine champion with combat training
- **Progression**: Cleric 1, Fighter 1-2, continue Cleric
- **Strengths**: Full spellcasting + martial abilities
- **Weaknesses**: Fewer high-level spells, complex resource management

### Arcane Trickster (Rogue/Wizard)
- **Concept**: Magical thief and infiltrator
- **Progression**: Rogue 3, Wizard 2, continue Rogue-heavy
- **Strengths**: Magic + skills, versatile problem-solving
- **Weaknesses**: Limited spell levels, requires INT and DEX

### Nature Warrior (Ranger/Barbarian)
- **Concept**: Primal warrior with survival skills
- **Progression**: Ranger 1-2, Barbarian levels, return to Ranger later
- **Strengths**: Rage + nature abilities, excellent survivability
- **Weaknesses**: No spells while raging, MAD requirements

### Warlock/Bard "Face"
- **Concept**: Ultimate social character with varied magic
- **Progression**: Warlock 2, Bard levels, Warlock 3 for pact
- **Strengths**: Short rest slots + inspiration, high CHA efficiency
- **Weaknesses**: Fewer spell slots overall, role overlap
