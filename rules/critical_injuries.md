# Critical Injury Tables

*Year Zero Engine-inspired injury system for the six-pool hybrid TTRPG*

## How Critical Injuries Work

### When You Suffer Critical Injuries
- **Pool reduced to 0 by attack**: Roll based on damage taken
- **Major damage**: Losing 3+ points from single attack  
- **Pushing while broken**: Voluntary choice for emergency points

### Injury Severity
- **1-2 points lost/gained**: Roll 1d20 (entries 1-20)
- **3-4 points lost/gained**: Roll 1d40 (entries 1-40)
- **5+ points lost/gained**: Roll 1d60 (entries 1-60)

### Critical Injury Properties
Each injury has:
- **Effect**: Mechanical penalty during healing
- **Healing Time**: Number of d6 to roll for healing time units
- **Special**: Additional rules (lethal, permanent, etc.)

### Healing Time System
- **Roll the specified d6**: Each die shows time units to heal
- **Time Units**: Hours (minor), days (moderate), or weeks (major) based on campaign pace
- **Medical Care**: Medicine check (DC 15) allows rerolling 1s
- **Magical Healing**: Reduces healing dice by half or heals instantly

## Special Rules

### Lethal Injuries
Some injuries are marked as **lethal** and require immediate medical attention:
- Make death saves at specified intervals
- DC starts at 10, increases by 2 each save
- Success: Stabilized until next interval
- Failure: Death
- **Stabilization**: Medicine check (DC 15) removes lethal status

### Permanent Injuries
Injuries marked **permanent** never heal naturally:
- Require magical healing to remove
- May leave lasting consequences even after healing
- Can define character's story and growth

### Multiple Injuries
- You can have multiple different injuries simultaneously
- Effects are cumulative (penalties stack)
- Each heals on its own timeline
- **Same Injury**: Reroll if you get the exact same injury twice

### Healing Acceleration
- **Medical Care**: Daily Medicine check (DC 15) doubles healing for that day
- **Magical Healing**: Lesser restoration removes minor injuries, greater restoration removes moderate, heal removes major
- **Rest**: Natural healing continues during adventuring
