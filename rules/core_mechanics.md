# Core Mechanics: Six-Pool Allocation System

*The foundation of our hybrid TTRPG combining strategic skill allocation with tactical gameplay*

## Overview

This system transforms traditional attributes into strategic resource pools. Instead of spending pools for temporary dice roll bonuses, you allocate pool points to activate skills and abilities that define your character's capabilities. Pools become your "character build currency" rather than expendable combat resources.

## Core Mechanic: Skill Allocation

### Allocation System
**Pool points are allocated to activate skills, NOT spent on dice rolls**

- **Allocation Time**: During long rests or extended downtime (4+ hours)
- **Permanent Until Changed**: Allocated points remain locked until reallocation
- **Multi-Pool Requirements**: Skills can require points from multiple pools
- **No Active Spending**: Pool points cannot be spent for temporary bonuses

### Dice Roll Resolution
**Base Formula: 1d20 + Proficiency + Skill Bonuses**

- **No Pool Spending**: You cannot spend pool points to modify dice rolls
- **Skill Bonuses**: All bonuses come from allocated skills
- **Proficiency**: Works normally from class and background
- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Functions as standard D&D rules

### Skill Types

#### Passive Skills
Always active while allocated:
- **Weapon Master** (4 STR): +2 to all weapon attack rolls
- **Combat Reflexes** (2 DEX + 1 WIS): +2 SP permanently  
- **Arcane Shield** (3 INT): +2 SP when concentrating on spells

#### Active Skills  
Must be triggered with an action:
- **Power Strike** (3 STR + 1 CON): Next attack deals double damage
- **Lightning Dodge** (4 DEX): Automatically dodge next attack
- **Spell Burst** (5 INT): Cast two cantrips as one action

#### Hybrid Skills
Both passive benefits and active abilities:
- **Hunter's Focus** (2 WIS + 2 DEX): +1 passive perception, active: mark target for advantage

## Pool Values & Progression

### Starting Pools (Level 1)
Distribution based on class focus and player choice:

**Total Points to Distribute: 69**
- **Minimum per pool**: 8 points
- **Class Primary**: Typically 15-18 points
- **Secondary pools**: 10-14 points  
- **Remaining**: 8-10 points each

### Pool Progression
- **Each Level**: +3 points to distribute among pools as desired
- **No Automatic Increases**: Player choice determines all allocation
- **Respec Option**: Can redistribute pools during major story milestones

### Example Starting Builds

**Fighter (STR Primary)**
- STR: 16, DEX: 12, CON: 14, INT: 8, WIS: 10, CHA: 9

**Rogue (DEX Primary)**  
- STR: 9, DEX: 16, CON: 12, INT: 12, WIS: 12, CHA: 8

**Wizard (INT Primary)**
- STR: 8, DEX: 12, CON: 10, INT: 18, WIS: 14, CHA: 9

## Defense Integration

### Three Defense Pools
Characters have separate defensive resources (see Defense System):

**Stamina Points (SP)**: Combat endurance from STR/CON/DEX
- Barbarian: 20 + CON mod per level
- Fighter/Ranger: 15 + CON mod per level  
- Rogue/Cleric/Warlock: 10 + CON mod per level
- Wizard/Bard: 5 + CON mod per level

**Armor Points (AP)**: Equipment protection
- Determined entirely by worn armor and shields
- No natural AP except through skills

**Stamina Points (SP)**: Combines blocking, dodging, and endurance  
- Base: 10 + (DEX Pool ÷ 3) + skill bonuses
- Represents dodging and reflexes in combat

### No Pool Damage
Pools are never reduced by damage:
- Attacks reduce SP/AP, never attribute pools
- Pool allocation remains stable regardless of combat damage
- Skills stay active unless voluntarily reallocated

## Skill Learning & Management

### Starting Skills (Level 1)
- **Basic Skills**: 3 skills total
- **Class Requirements**: Some skills restricted by class
- **Pool Requirements**: Must have sufficient points to activate

### Skill Progression
- **Every 2 Levels**: Learn 1 new skill
- **Class Features**: Unlock specific powerful skills
- **Training**: Learn additional skills during downtime

### Reallocation Rules
- **Long Rest**: Can reallocate all pool points
- **Short Rest**: Can reallocate 25% of total pools (emergency respec)
- **Story Milestones**: Major character development allows full reallocation

## Character Differentiation

### Build Archetypes

**Specialists**: Focus pools heavily in 1-2 areas
- High-power skills in specialty
- Limited versatility
- Extreme effectiveness in chosen area

**Generalists**: Spread pools across 3-4 areas  
- Moderate skills in multiple areas
- High adaptability
- Good at many things, master of few

**Hybrids**: Unusual multi-pool combinations
- Skills requiring diverse pool allocations
- Unique capabilities
- Interesting tactical options

### Multi-Pool Synergies
Skills that combine pools create unique builds:
- **STR + INT**: Scholar-warrior combinations
- **CHA + CON**: Inspiring tough leaders  
- **WIS + DEX**: Perceptive scouts
- **All Pools**: Legendary skills requiring massive investment

## Strategic Considerations

### Pool Management
- **Allocation Planning**: Consider your party role and expected challenges
- **Flexibility vs Power**: Specialized builds vs adaptable ones
- **Skill Synergies**: Combinations that work well together
- **Future Growth**: Plan for skills you'll learn later

### Daily Adaptation
- **Morning Allocation**: Change skills based on expected day
- **Emergency Respec**: Use short rest reallocation for surprises
- **Party Coordination**: Complement allies' skill choices
- **Environmental Factors**: Some areas may favor certain allocations

### Risk Management
- **Core Skills**: Always maintain essential abilities
- **Backup Options**: Keep some unallocated points for flexibility
- **Situational Skills**: Temporary allocations for specific challenges
- **Recovery Planning**: Consider how to handle skill disruption

## Integration with D20 System

### Attack Rolls

- **Skill Enhancement**: Allocated skills provide all bonuses
- **DC Values**: Standard D&D difficulty classes (10, 15, 20, etc.)
- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Works normally with skill bonuses

### Saving Throws
