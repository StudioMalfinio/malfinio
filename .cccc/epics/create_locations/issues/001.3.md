# Issue #001.3: Create Example Location Implementation

## Overview
Develop a complete reference location using the established template and visual style guide to serve as implementation example and quality benchmark for all subsequent location creation.

## Files to Modify
1. `world/locations/windshear-cove.md` (new)
2. `world/locations/assets/windshear-cove-overview.png` (new)

## Implementation Sketch

Create comprehensive reference location demonstrating all template elements:

**Windshear Cove - Small Fishing Village:**
- Population: ~200 residents
- Remote location on outer archipelago island
- Known for dangerous tidal winds and excellent deepwater fishing
- Traditional architecture adapted to harsh coastal conditions
- Isolated community with strong maritime traditions

**Full Template Implementation:**
- Rich atmospheric description (600+ words)
- Historical background connecting to archipelago settlement patterns
- Current status showing economic and social dynamics
- 3-4 adventure hooks ranging from simple to complex
- Notable NPCs with clear motivations and relationships
- Economic information (primary industries, trade connections)
- Geographic details supporting tactical encounters

**Visual Map Creation:**
- Village overview map following style guide standards
- Key buildings and landmarks clearly marked
