## Implementation Sketch
Create comprehensive template with sections:

```markdown

type: [city|town|village|ruins|natural|magical]
region: [Geographic region within archipelago]
population: [Estimated population or "Unknown"]
created: [ISO datetime]
---

# [Location Name]

## Classification

## Description
2-3 paragraphs of physical appearance and layout

## History
