## Overview
Conduct systematic quality assurance review of all created locations to ensure consistency, accuracy, and professional standards across the entire location expansion.

## Files to Modify
1. `world/locations/quality-review-checklist.md` (new)
2. `world/locations/consistency-report.md` (new)
3. All location files (modify as needed based on review findings)

## Implementation Sketch

Implement comprehensive quality validation process:

**Content Quality Review:**
- Writing quality assessment against professional TTRPG publication standards
- Tone and style consistency with existing Malfinio worldbuilding
- Descriptive richness ensuring immersive gameplay experience
- Adventure hook viability and creative potential evaluation
- NPC characterization depth and motivation clarity

**Lore Consistency Validation:**
- Cross-reference all locations against archipelago_geography.md
- Verify faction relationships align with factions.md established dynamics  
- Check magical elements consistency with magic_theory.md principles
- Validate historical timeline integration across all locations
- Ensure economic relationships reflect realistic trade patterns

**Technical Standards Compliance:**
- Template adherence verification across all location documents
- File naming convention consistency throughout location directory
- Map quality assessment against established visual style guide
- Cross-reference link functionality and accuracy testing
- Markdown formatting and structure standardization

**Gameplay Usability Testing:**
- GM preparation time assessment for each location (target <5 minutes)
- Adventure hook implementation feasibility review
- Tactical encounter space adequacy evaluation  
- Resource requirement clarity for specialized activities
- Player agency opportunity identification and enhancement

**Integration Quality Assessment:**
- Location interconnection strength and logical flow
- Trade route coherence and economic viability
- Political relationship complexity and conflict potential
- Cultural diversity representation across archipelago communities
- Geographic distribution balance ensuring campaign variety

**Systematic Review Process:**
- Individual location quality scoring against established criteria
- Cross-location consistency verification matrix
- Integration gap identification and resolution planning
- Priority ranking for any required revisions or improvements
- Final approval certification for campaign-ready status

**Quality Metrics Framework:**
- Content word count targets (village 600+, city 1500+, unique 1000+)
- Adventure hook quantity minimums (village 3+, city 5+, unique 4+)
- Cross-reference density requirements (minimum 3 per location)
- Map quality standards (resolution, clarity, style guide compliance)
- Historical integration depth measurement

**Revision Planning:**
- Identified issues categorized by severity (critical, important, minor)
- Revision priority scheduling based on impact and dependency
- Quality improvement recommendations for future location creation
- Template and style guide updates based on review findings
- Final certification criteria for campaign-ready status
