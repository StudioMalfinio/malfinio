# Issue #005.1: Create trade route and economic connections

## Overview
Establish comprehensive trade networks and economic relationships between all created locations to form a realistic and interconnected maritime economy that supports campaign logistics and adventure opportunities.

## Files to Modify
1. `world/locations/port-maristos.md` (modify - add trade connections)
2. `world/locations/merchants-rest.md` (modify - add economic details)
3. `world/setting_overview.md` (modify - add trade route summary)

## Implementation Sketch

**Trade Route Network Documentation:**

Create comprehensive shipping routes connecting:
- **Major Hub Routes:** Port Maristos ↔ Merchants Rest (primary commercial corridor)
- **Resource Routes:** Ironcliff Outpost → Port Maristos (metals and gems)
- **Supply Routes:** Saltmere Village → Thornwatch Citadel (food and provisions)
- **Magical Routes:** Crystalcove Academy ↔ Whisperwind Observatory (knowledge/research)
- **Emergency Routes:** Driftwood Waystation serving as resupply point for all routes

**Economic Relationship Matrix:**
```
Location → Exports → Primary Markets
Port Maristos → Finished goods, diplomatic services → All locations
Merchants Rest → Neutral banking, information → Major centers
Ironcliff Outpost → Raw metals, gems → Port Maristos, Thornwatch
Saltmere Village → Fresh fish, preserved foods → All locations
Crystalcove Academy → Magical research, enchanted items → Wealthy locations
Whisperwind Observatory → Astronomical data, weather prediction → Maritime locations
Driftwood Waystation → Transportation, storage services → All routes
Thornwatch Citadel → Security services, military supplies → Allied locations
```

**Trade Implementation Details:**
- Shipping schedules and seasonal variations
- Commodity prices and market fluctuations
- Trade company operations and merchant house territories
- Transportation methods (ships, magical transport, overland)
- Economic vulnerabilities and adventure opportunities

**Integration Updates:**
- Add trade sections to each location file
- Update `world/setting_overview.md` with economic overview
- Cross-reference existing faction relationships with trade partnerships
