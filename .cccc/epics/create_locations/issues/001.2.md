# Issue #001.2: Create Visual Style Guide for Location Maps

## Overview
Establish consistent visual standards and design guidelines for all location maps to ensure professional quality and visual coherence across the maritime archipelago setting.

## Files to Modify
1. `world/locations/style-guide.md` (new)
2. `world/locations/assets/style-samples/` (new directory)

## Implementation Sketch

Create comprehensive visual style guide covering:

**Map Design Standards:**
- Consistent color palette reflecting maritime themes (blues, greens, earth tones)
- Typography standards for location names, features, and scale indicators
- Icon library for common features (ports, settlements, ruins, natural features)
- Scale and proportion guidelines for different map types (regional, city, district)
- Grid systems for tactical encounter maps where applicable

**Technical Specifications:**
- File format requirements (PNG for detailed maps, JPG for reference images)
- Resolution standards (minimum 1200px width for city maps, 800px for regional)
- File naming conventions (location-name-type.format)
- Asset organization structure within locations/ directory

**Visual Elements:**
- Compass roses and scale indicators
- Border and frame design for finished maps
- Legend and key formatting
- Texture and shading techniques for terrain representation
- Water feature representation (harbors, channels, open ocean)

**Sample Templates:**
- Regional archipelago overview template
- Major city/port template  
- Village/settlement template
- Natural feature/ruin template
- Tactical encounter space template

**Quality Standards:**
- Readability requirements for GM reference during gameplay
- Print-friendly design considerations
- Digital display optimization
- Accessibility guidelines (color blind friendly palette)
