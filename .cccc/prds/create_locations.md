# PRD: Create Locations

## Executive Summary

Expand the Malfinio system's maritime archipelago worldbuilding by creating at least 10 detailed locations that serve as adventure sites, cultural centers, and narrative anchors for gameplay. Each location will include comprehensive descriptions, visual maps, and rich historical context that integrates with the existing three-path magic system and archipelago geography.

**Value Proposition:** Transform the Malfinio setting from a framework into a living, adventure-ready world that Game Masters can immediately use for campaigns.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** The Malfinio system has excellent mechanics and broad worldbuilding framework (archipelago geography, magic theory, factions) but lacks specific, detailed locations where adventures actually happen.

**Problem:** Game Masters need concrete, well-developed locations with:
- Rich narrative hooks and adventure opportunities
- Historical context that connects to broader world themes
- Visual references for immersive gameplay
- Integration with existing Malfinio mechanics and lore

**Why Now:** Phase 4 worldbuilding is active, and detailed locations are essential before moving to Phase 3 documentation and adventure creation. Locations inform final rule adjustments and provide context for Player's Handbook examples.

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: Game Master
- **As a GM**, I want detailed location descriptions so I can run immersive sessions without extensive prep work
- **As a GM**, I want location histories so I can create meaningful connections to player backstories and ongoing campaigns
- **As a GM**, I want visual maps so I can show players where they are and facilitate tactical encounters
- **As a GM**, I want locations that integrate with Malfinio mechanics so the system feels cohesive during play

### Secondary Persona: Player
- **As a player**, I want rich location descriptions so I can visualize and connect with the game world
- **As a player**, I want locations with clear cultural elements so I can make informed character choices
- **As a player**, I want locations that support the maritime theme so the setting feels authentic

### Tertiary Persona: Adventure Designer
- **As an adventure designer**, I want location stat blocks and mechanical elements so I can create balanced encounters
- **As an adventure designer**, I want interconnected locations so I can design multi-session campaigns

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Location Elements (Per Location)
- **Name and Classification** (city, village, ruins, natural feature, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Description** (2-3 paragraphs minimum)
  - Physical appearance and layout
  - Cultural atmosphere and daily life
  - Notable features and landmarks
- **Visual Map** 
  - Hand-drawn or digital illustration
  - Key areas labeled and numbered
  - Scale and navigation references
- **Historical Background** (1-2 paragraphs)
  - Founding or creation story
  - Major events that shaped the location
  - Connection to broader archipelago history
- **Current Status**
  - Population and demographics
  - Economic activities and trade
  - Political situation and leadership
- **Adventure Hooks** (3-5 specific plot seeds)
- **Mechanical Integration**
  - Relevant skill challenges for the location
  - Connection to magic system paths
  - Zone-based exploration opportunities

#### Location Diversity Requirements
- **Settlement Types:** At least 3 major cities, 2 smaller towns, 2 villages
- **Geographic Variety:** Different island types (volcanic, coral, mountainous, etc.)
- **Cultural Diversity:** Representing different factions and magical traditions
- **Historical Periods:** Locations from different eras of archipelago history
- **Adventure Potential:** Mix of social, exploration, and combat-focused locations

#### Integration Requirements
- **Consistency with Existing Lore**
  - Align with established archipelago geography
  - Reference existing factions and magic theory
  - Connect to maritime themes and travel mechanics
- **Cross-References**
  - Locations reference each other appropriately
  - Trade routes and political connections established
  - Historical events create logical relationships

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Quality Standards
- **Writing Quality:** Professional, evocative prose suitable for publication
- **Visual Standards:** Maps must be clear, legible, and atmospheric
- **Consistency:** Unified tone and style across all locations
- **Usability:** Easy for GMs to quickly reference during sessions

#### Scope Management
- **Depth vs. Breadth:** Each location should be substantial enough for multiple sessions
- **Scalability:** Framework should support adding more locations later
- **Modularity:** Locations can be used independently or as part of larger campaigns

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Location Count:** Minimum 10 locations delivered
- **Content Volume:** Average 1,500-2,000 words per location
- **Visual Assets:** One detailed map per location
- **Adventure Hooks:** 35+ unique plot seeds across all locations

### Qualitative Metrics
- **GM Usability:** Locations provide enough detail for immediate use
- **Player Engagement:** Rich descriptions support immersive roleplay
- **System Integration:** Locations naturally incorporate Malfinio mechanics
- **Narrative Coherence:** Locations feel like part of a unified world

### Validation Criteria
- **Lore Consistency Check:** No contradictions with existing worldbuilding
- **Mechanical Integration:** Each location supports multiple Malfinio subsystems
- **Adventure Potential:** Each location can support 2-3 session adventures
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Maritime themes feel genuine and researched

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **File Format:** Markdown documentation with embedded images
- **Image Requirements:** Maps must be web-friendly formats (PNG/JPG)
- **Integration:** Must fit within existing world/ directory structure

### Creative Constraints
- **Setting Boundaries:** Must align with established archipelago geography
- **Tone Consistency:** Must match existing Malfinio worldbuilding voice
- **Mechanical Limits:** Cannot introduce new rules or contradict existing systems

### Resource Constraints
- **Timeline:** Should align with Phase 4 worldbuilding completion
- **Scope Management:** Focus on breadth over extreme detail per location
- **Documentation Standards:** Must follow existing project style guide

### Assumptions
- **Target Audience:** GMs familiar with tactical RPGs and worldbuilding
- **Usage Context:** Locations will be referenced during active gameplay
- **System Knowledge:** Users understand Malfinio mechanics and setting basics
- **Campaign Integration:** Locations will be mixed and matched for different campaigns

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included
- **Statistical NPC Stat Blocks** (covered in future phases)
- **Detailed Encounter Designs** (adventure module content)
- **Player Character Creation Options** (backgrounds, equipment specific to locations)
- **Economic System Details** (trade rules, currency mechanics)
- **Large-Scale Political Mechanics** (kingdom management, mass combat)

### Future Considerations
- **Digital Tool Integration** (Phase 5 - digital implementation)
- **Interactive Map Features** (clickable, zoom functionality)
- **Extended Location Network** (additional locations beyond initial 10)
- **Seasonal Variations** (how locations change over time)
