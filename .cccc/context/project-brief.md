# Project Brief

## Project Definition
**Malfinio System Development:** Creating a tactical role-playing game that combines Cypher System resource management, D&D 5e combat mechanics, and Year Zero Engine consequences into a cohesive, streamlined gaming experience called Malfinio.

## What It Does
- **Simplifies Tactical Combat:** Eliminates complex distance calculations while maintaining strategic positioning
- **Enhances Resource Management:** Pool system creates meaningful choices about when to spend resources
- **Maintains Familiar Mechanics:** D&D-style combat and progression with innovative additions
- **Provides Complete System:** Character creation through 20th level with all necessary subsystems

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Existing tactical RPGs suffer from:
- **Complex Distance Math:** Time-consuming range and movement calculations
- **Binary Success/Failure:** Limited player agency in crucial moments
- **Resource Limitations:** Insufficient meaningful choices in resource management
- **System Complexity:** Steep learning curves for tactical positioning

### Solution Approach
- **Grid Simplification:** Square-based movement with clear positioning rules
- **Pool Enhancement:** Spend points to influence outcomes strategically
- **Familiar Foundation:** Build on D&D 5e knowledge base
- **Modular Development:** Complete core systems before expanding

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Complete Rule System:** All mechanics for character creation through play âœ…
- **Maritime Setting:** Archipelago world with comprehensive locations ðŸ”„
- **CCCC Workflow Integration:** GitHub-based development management âœ…
- **Location Expansion:** 11 major settlements + special sites ðŸ”„
- **Documentation:** Player's Handbook and Game Master's Guide
- **Digital Tools:** Player and GM assistant applications

### Out of Scope
- **Multiple Settings:** Single maritime archipelago world
- **Video Game Adaptation:** Tabletop focus only
- **Miniature System:** Grid-based but not miniature-dependent
- **Competitive Play:** Cooperative storytelling focus

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete Playable System:** All rules functional and integrated âœ…
