# Project Brief

## Project Definition
**Malfinio System Development:** Creating a tactical role-playing game that combines Cypher System resource management, D&D 5e combat mechanics, and Year Zero Engine consequences into a cohesive, streamlined gaming experience called Malfinio.

## What It Does
- **Simplifies Tactical Combat:** Eliminates complex distance calculations while maintaining strategic positioning
- **Enhances Resource Management:** Pool system creates meaningful choices about when to spend resources
- **Maintains Familiar Mechanics:** D&D-style combat and progression with innovative additions
- **Provides Complete System:** Character creation through 20th level with all necessary subsystems

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Existing tactical RPGs suffer from:
- **Complex Distance Math:** Time-consuming range and movement calculations
- **Binary Success/Failure:** Limited player agency in crucial moments
- **Resource Limitations:** Insufficient meaningful choices in resource management
- **System Complexity:** Steep learning curves for tactical positioning

### Solution Approach
- **Grid Simplification:** Square-based movement with clear positioning rules
- **Pool Enhancement:** Spend points to influence outcomes strategically
- **Familiar Foundation:** Build on D&D 5e knowledge base
- **Modular Development:** Complete core systems before expanding

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Complete Rule System:** All mechanics for character creation through play
- **Maritime Setting:** Archipelago world with supporting lore and factions
- **Digital Tools:** Player and GM assistant applications
- **Playtesting Materials:** Adventures and pre-generated characters
- **Documentation:** Player's Handbook and Game Master's Guide

### Out of Scope
- **Multiple Settings:** Single maritime archipelago world
- **Video Game Adaptation:** Tabletop focus only
- **Miniature System:** Grid-based but not miniature-dependent
- **Competitive Play:** Cooperative storytelling focus

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete Playable System:** All rules functional and integrated
2. **Successful Playtesting:** 4+ hour sessions demonstrate system viability
3. **Streamlined Combat:** Faster resolution than comparable systems
4. **Strategic Depth:** Meaningful choices in character building and play

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Rule Completeness:** 100% of core systems documented and tested
- **Player Satisfaction:** Positive feedback on tactical experience
- **Learning Curve:** New players functional within one session
- **Digital Integration:** Tools enhance rather than complicate play

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1 & 2:** Complete (Core systems and extensions)
- **Phase 4:** Active (Worldbuilding - Maritime archipelago setting)
- **Phase 3:** Next (Documentation and materials creation)
- **Phase 5:** Future (Digital tool development)
- **Phase 6:** Final (Playtesting and refinement)

## Strategic Vision
Create the definitive tactical RPG for players who want strategic depth without mathematical complexity, supported by digital tools that enhance storytelling and streamline gameplay logistics. **Malfinio** will be the new standard for hybrid tactical systems.
